-- 
-- ATS - Active Thermal Solution
-- This program control fan for RockPro64, or other boards
--
-- Nota :
--      Temperature can be more than real because of self heating..

-- Nota:
--     Since many people have its own thermal Solution, and there are a so great variation in Temperature/Humidity around the globe,
--     Its virtually impossible to create a solution to fit all..

--[[ By Experience, without Underclock, with cpufreq Scalling 'Ondemand',
     And with all CPUs at 100%, the temperature should not grow more than ~57/58C,
     But it depends of the HeatSink/Fan characteristics/Environment around..

     Nota:
         For Safety Reasons,
         It Starts with 'MAX_CONTINUOUS_THERMAL_TEMP' limit( in the worst case cenario, we could not be able to read correctly the temps initially... )

     In the absence of proper Active Thermal Solution, to cool down( weak or dead fan? ),
     It will adjust temps only until 'ABSOLUTE_MAX_THERMAL_TEMP' were reached, were then, it Shutdown in 10s( for safety reasons.. )

---- Tests Done
--

--[[ This tool was tested 24x7, for more than 5 months, under Full Load, with:
     < Minimal Debian Strech release >, and also < Ubuntu bionic >, both by ayufan,
     But it should work with DietPi,Armbian, ArchLinux, etc
     In next releases SysVinit based OSes, such Devuan ASCII should also work..

     Adjust Values Bellow to Get best Conditions, for your board, heatsink, and Fan specs..
     To add comments, just put "--" before the comment
